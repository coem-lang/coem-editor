This [CodeMirror 6: Getting Started](https://blog.datacamp.engineering/codemirror-6-getting-started-7fd08f467ed2) tutorial was extremely helpful in getting to know CodeMirror, especially CodeMirror 6.

Many of the basic extensions for setting up the editor were taken from [@code-mirror/basic-setup](https://github.com/codemirror/basic-setup/).
